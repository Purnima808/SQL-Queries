/*Select Statement: Detailed Introduction
Select helps you to extract data from the tables. 
Remember, it doesn't make any changes to data of the tables. 

SELECT <filed1>, <field2>
FROM <dbname>.<table>
WHERE <condition(s)>;

SQL Execution Sequence ->			
1 - From 
2 - Where (if specified); 
Last - SELECT						

Ideal steps to write Select statement: 
1. Visualize the output / report that you want to create
2. Think of the execution sequence (From which table, what conditions, what do we have to select) 
3. Write the Select Statement

A function looks like -> funcName() 
It will always return something.
Some functions accept parameters or arguments. 
Eg. Round(8.89, 1)  -> 8.9
Please note â€“ a function will have always have a pair of brackets as suffix  
There are functions for: 
1. Numeric Calculations 
2. Date / Time Calculations
3. String Cleaning / Manipulation 
4. Advanced functions
